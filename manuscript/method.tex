\section{Study 1}

\subsection{Methods}

\subsubsection{Participants}

Describe your sample here. Below you can find a random equation

\begin{equation}
f = \sqrt{\frac{\eta_{p}^{2}}{1-\eta_{p}^{2}}}
\end{equation}

which I only added to intimidate the reader of the template.

\subsubsection{Material}

Here I will briefly describe the material of the study.

\paragraph{Apparatus}
VPixx here, Eyelink there...The typical paragraph to skip when you read a paper.


\paragraph{Stimuli}
Just a description of our typical lines and circles, i.e. the puristic beauty of psychophysics.
